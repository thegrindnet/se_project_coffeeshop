## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

### Improvement 1

When it comes to using the nav bar, when you click on one of the links the transition is pretty harsh. I'd like to implement a smooth transition so that when you click on the link it will glide across the appropriate section.

### Improvement 2

Making the form functional in the Reservations block would be a great way to improve this site.
